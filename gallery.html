<h4>One swallow doesn't make summer.</h4>
<p>In Aesop's fable (number 169), a young man sees a swallow on a warm winter day. Thinking that winter is over, he sells off his woolen coat, and with the money he's made he goes to the bar and drinks. 
    Unfortunately, in the days that follow the temperature drops and the young man, shivering in the cold, realizes that one swallow does not make a summer.
    Meaning:
    Don't draw a premature conclusion based on a single fact
    This saying is also attributed to an allusion to the return of migrating swallows at the start of the summer season. From a remark by 
    Aristotle: "One swallow does not a summer make, nor one fine day; similarly one day or brief time of happiness does not make a person entirely happy."</p>

    <h4>What goes around comes around.</h4>
    <p>The phrases "what goes around, comes around" convey an idea similar to what comes around, goes around
        Original Phrase: "What goes around, comes around" suggests that actions—especially negative ones—will eventually return to the person 
        who performed them. It emphasizes the cyclical nature of karma or consequences. While the core concept of karma is retained in both 
        phrases, the altered version may sound less familiar and could lead to some confusion. The original phrase is widely recognized, so 
        using it is generally clearer and more effective in conveying the intended meaning.

    <h4>The pot calling the kettle black</h4>
    <p>The term “the pot calling the kettle black” is usually used in the sense of accusing someone of hypocrisy. The origins of the phrase 
        date back to at least the 1600s, when several writers published books or plays which included wordplays on this theme. Despite 
        suggestions that the phrase is racist or nonsensical, the meaning is actually quite obvious when one considers the conditions of a 
        medieval kitchen.
        Meaning:
        Typically, pots and kettles were made from heavy materials like cast iron to ensure that they would last and hold up to heat. Cast iron
        tends to turn black with use, as it collects oil, food residue, and smoke from the kitchen. Both pots and kettles would also have been 
        heated over an open fire in a kitchen. As a result, they would have become streaked with black smoke despite the best cleaning efforts.
        Since both are black, the pot calling the kettle black would clearly be an act of hypocrisy. The act could also be described by “it 
        takes one to know one,” and it suggests a certain blindness to one's personal characteristics. There is another explanation for the term,
        involving the pot seeing its black reflection reflected in a polished copper kettle. In this sense, the pot does not realize that it is 
        describing itself.

    <h4>To fall from the frying pan into the fire</h4>
    <p>It simply means leaving a bad situation and getting into a worse one. For instance, being abused as a child by your parents and thinking
        marriage would be an escape. Instead you get married and realize your spouse is a worse abuser than both parents combined.

    <h4>Too many cooks, spoil the broth</h4>
    <p>It means that having too many people involved in the planning or creation of a thing is likely to cause more problems than it solves. 
        Don't have a planning committee of twenty when three will do. Don't take suggestions from everyone, just a few.

    <h4>Don’t cry over spilled milk</h4>
    <p>It means “don’t make a fuss about things that have already happened and can’t be changed.”
        When milk has been spilled, it can’t be picked up and put back in the cup or bottle, so it will not do any good for us to cry about 
        it. We just have to forget it and move on to something else. That’s the origin of this phrase. It might be used like this:  “I’m really
        upset because I got 75% on the math test. I feel terrible! I’m a failure!”
        “Well, don’t cry over spilt milk. Just study hard so you can do better next time.”

    <h4>Be it so</h4>
    <p>"So be it" is an abdication of responsibility, or an acknowledgment of the situation. In sentence 1a it means something like "If you 
        really want to throw your career away because of some idealistic principle, I guess that's how it will be". "Be it so" is nearly the 
        opposite. It is an order or a grant of permission. Sentence 1b means "If you really want to throw your career away because of some 
        idealistic principle, I order (or allow) it to be so".
        </p>

<section id="Detail9" class="Details">
    <h4>To wake up on wrong side of the bed</h4>
    <p>The origin of the expression ‘wake up on the wrong side of the bed’ is thought to come from ancient Rome. Romans were very careful always 
        to get up on the correct side of the bed to ensure that good luck would follow them through their days. If they got up “left foot 
        forward” or “on the wrong side of the bed,” they believed that they would be unlucky. You use the phrase ‘Wake up on the Wrong Side of the Bed’ to indicate that someone
        is in a bad mood.

    <h4>Play by ear</h4>
    <p>To do something without special preparation to decide how to deal with a situation as it develops, rather than acting according to plans 
        made earlier. We can't make a decision yet. Let's just play it by ear.
        More explanation: This phrase means the speaker doesn’t want to make a fixed plan for something. Instead, the speaker wants to decide 
        what to do at the time the thing happens. So, we use the idiom ‘play something by ear’ when we want to be more flexible with our plans. 
        It is often used in everyday conversation, especially when talking about less formal arrangements, for example, social or travel plans. 
        This idiom comes from music where ‘playing something by ear’ means to play a musical instrument without reading from a music sheet.

    <h4>Jump down someone's throat</h4>
    <p>This is not a commonly used phrase, but it means that you are being subjected to unreasonable pressure to accept the validity of another’s 
        opinion or to react in a way that suits that person. Like making pate de fois gras, where food is forced down the throat of a goose, you 
        are having ideas and obligations forced into your mind. it would always be an unwelcome imposition.

<section id="Detail12" class="Detailed">
    <h4>Get off my back</h4>
    <p>The idiom "get off my back" is an informal expression used to tell someone to stop bothering, criticizing, or harassing you. It conveys 
        a sense of frustration and a desire for the other person to give you space or stop their interference. Essentially, it means "leave me 
        alone" or "stop nagging me."
